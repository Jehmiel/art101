			<h1>Hello World</h1>
				
			<p>We're Jehmiel and Kyle and we are both 3rd years AGPM majors. We met last spring in another mutual class and partner up for this lab.
				 Little bit about Jehmiel, he's Filipino and is from Southern California and like to eat Pho. Kyle is a junior in AGPM and is taking this class because of his elective for his major.
				 He is originally from Southern California too but came here for school because of the campus. He has little coding experience but is confident that he can pick things up pretty quickly due to his
				 experience with computers and technology. </p>

			<h2>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h2>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h3>Challenge</h3>
					<p>Create a basic HTML file and a CSS style file, edit it, view it in your browser, and inspect it.</p>

					<h3>Problems</h3>
					<p>Most of the problems we had was CSS problems. We solve most of them through trial and error and looking up some solutions in the basics.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>So this assignment wasn't too bad, once we got the hang of everything it was mostly smooth sailing. There were always a few minor issues like getting stuck on error all because we missed a semicolon.   </p>
