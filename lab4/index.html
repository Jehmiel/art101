			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to pseudocode an everyday task and a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No real problems, just took time to figure out the step by step for each task.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was an interesting task to just breakdown everything into a step by step list. I normally don't have everything in a detailed list like pseudocoding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p>Screenshots of our pseudocode of washing the dishes and rock, paper, scissors</p>
						<img src="img/dish.png">
						<pre><code>
							//Pseudocode of Rock Paper Scissors
							//Accept input from player 1 for rock, paper, or scissors
							//Start countdown timer 
							  //When the countdown timer ends, both players moves are revealed
							//Choose random number between 1 and 3
							  //If number is one, then return rock
							  //If number is two, then return paper
							  //If number is three, then return scissors
							//Test for win/lose condition
							  //If player 1 has rock, and number is 1, then it is a tie
							  //If player 1 has rock and number is 2, then player 1 loses
							  //If player 1 has rock and number is 2, then player 1 wins
							  //If player 1 has paper and number is 1, then player 1 wins
							  //If player 1 has paper and number is 2, then it is a tie
							  //If player 1 has paper and number is 3, then player 1 loses
							  //If player 1 has scissors and number is 1, then player 1 loses
							  //If player 1 has scissors and number is 2, then player 1 wins
							  //If player 1 has scissors and number is 3, then it is a tie
							//After the round program restarts with a loop to continue playing.
