					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some minor problems I came across was just transitioning the fuction from lab 7 to this lab. One problem that kept coming up was matching my differnt variables to the next part of the fucntion. I had different names from the example so it took some time to find and match the different variables. Also the missing # for the id came up from time to time, other than these minor issues it was relatively simple lab.   </p>
