			<h1>Lab 9: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div class="challenge">

					<p>To experiment with jQuery and make buttons that change.</p>

			<div class="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some of the problems I ran into was accidently added two links of my JS file and that produced 2 buttons instead of one. But for the most part this lab just took some time to get used to what jQuery is and the change it does on CSS.</p>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The results are shown on the "Change" buttons.</p>
